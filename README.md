# Weather-Buddy-App-FreshDesk
Freshdesk app that displays the weather for the support agent in the Ticket Page.
The app also allows an agent to pick an alternate city and a future date (within 5 days) and display the weather for the same. The agent will only be interested in 2 weather parameters - Temperature and Wind Speed.


# Tips of Implementation of this app:
Displaying the weather information for support agent, I have used an API of "OpenWeatherMap" services. To get the APP ID of relevant services or desired functionality, please refer over here: https://openweathermap.org/api.
